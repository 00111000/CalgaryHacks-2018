## Inspiration

Occurance of public shootings has increases in the last few years. In case of an emergency in is not always possible for the hostages to contact the police, but even if they find the chanse, it usually take at least a minute.

We decided to create a solution that will notify the emergency services in case a shooting has happened, the following are some benefits our solution introduces: 

- Shorten the time for contacting the emergency services.
- Reduced the overhead for emergency services.
- Provide more safety for public.
- Multiple services could be notifed at once.

## What it does

CeroBuks is a multilevel application, which was designed to notify users is critical situations by moderm ways of communication such as Twitter, phone calls, and SMS.

## How we built it

- Used Python, Java, and C programming languages.
- Used the `tweepy` Python library to send custom tweets.
- Used DreamWeaver to create analytical dashboard.
- Used MySQL database to record and store metadata from the sensors.

A background script runs in the background and continually receives updates from the gateway if a noice above the threshold was recorded by the sensor.
